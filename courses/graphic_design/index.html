                <h4>What is graphic design?</h4>
                <div class="def">
                    Graphic design is the art and practice of planning and projecting ideas and experiences with visual and textual content. It is a creative process that combines images, words, and typography to communicate a message in a visually appealing way. Graphic designers work on a wide range of projects, from logos and branding to websites and magazines.
<br>
                    The goal of graphic design is to communicate a message effectively and efficiently. Graphic designers use their skills to create visuals that are both informative and engaging. They consider the target audience, the purpose of the message, and the medium it will be delivered in when designing their work.
       <br>             
                    Graphic design is an essential part of our everyday lives. We see it in the logos of the brands we love, the packaging of the products we buy, and the websites we visit. Graphic designers play a vital role in shaping the visual world around us.

                                Hierarchy in graphic design utilizes several key principles, including size, color, contrast, alignment, repetition, and brightness, to emphasize certain characteristics of the design. It controls those factors in order to show importance within the design as a whole.

                                Alignment in graphics design is one of those not-so-well understood subjects that carry a lot of importance. Correctly applying the principles of alignment in graphic design can improve one's work tenfold by yielding a clearer, much easier-to-understand work. On the other hand, incorrect use of alignment makes a design appear cluttered and unfinished and can be very hard to understand.

                                Balance definition in graphic design is offsetting how the graphical weight of components balance with each other on either side of a design to create satisfaction, completion, and cohesion. Your composition should balance diagonally, horizontally, vertically, or foreground versus background to achieve visual balance.

                                The proximity principle is the idea that placing similar design elements close together produces a more effective visual design. This is because the physical location of each item in the design creates a spatial relationship with other features on the page</small>

                                Repetition has a soothing element to it. It lets you know what to expect: what's coming next and what you can expect to see. In graphic design, repetition can create that same soothing feel or highlight specific elements of your piece while adding texture and interest.

                                Simplicity in graphic design is about using as few elements as possible to make a powerful impact.
