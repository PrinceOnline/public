                <h4>What is graphic design?</h4>
                <div class="def">
                    Graphic design is the art and practice of planning and projecting ideas and experiences with visual and textual content. It is a creative process that combines images, words, and typography to communicate a message in a visually appealing way. Graphic designers work on a wide range of projects, from logos and branding to websites and magazines.
<br>
                    The goal of graphic design is to communicate a message effectively and efficiently. Graphic designers use their skills to create visuals that are both informative and engaging. They consider the target audience, the purpose of the message, and the medium it will be delivered in when designing their work.
       <br>             
                    Graphic design is an essential part of our everyday lives. We see it in the logos of the brands we love, the packaging of the products we buy, and the websites we visit. Graphic designers play a vital role in shaping the visual world around us.

                                    Typography is the art and technique of arranging type. It is the foundation of graphic design, and graphic designers use typography to create visually appealing and readable text.

                                <b>HTML tags:</b> HTML tags are used to define the different elements of a web page. 
                                They are always enclosed in angle brackets (&lt; >). The start tag defines the 
                                beginning of an element, and the end tag defines the end of an element.
                                <br><b>Attributes:</b> Attributes are additional pieces of information that can be added 
                                to HTML tags. They are always enclosed in quotes, and they are placed after the 
                                tag name. For example, the &lt;a href="https://www.google.com"> tag defines a link 
                                to the Google website. The href attribute specifies the URL of the link.
                                <br> <b>Elements:</b> Elements are the basic building blocks of HTML pages. They are defined by HTML tags and attributes. Some common elements include headings, paragraphs, lists, images, and tables.
                                <br><b>Structure:</b> The structure of an HTML page is defined by the way the elements are nested. For example, a paragraph element can be nested inside a heading element.
                                <br><b>Formatting:</b> The formatting of an HTML page is defined by CSS. CSS is a separate language that is used to style the appearance of web pages.
                                Here are some of the most common HTML tags:
                                <br><b>Head tag:</b> The &lt;head> tag defines the head of an HTML page. The head contains information about the page, such as the title, keywords, and styles.
                                <br><b>Body tag:</b> The &lt;body> tag defines the body of an HTML page. The body contains the content of the page, such as text, images, and videos.
                                <br><b>Heading tags:</b> The &lt;h1> to &lt;h6> tags are used to define headings. The &lt;h1> tag is the largest heading, and the &lt;h6> tag is the smallest heading.
                                <br><b>Paragraph tag:</b> The &lt;p> tag is used to define a paragraph.
                                <br><b>List tags:</b> The &lt;ul>, &lt;ol>, and &lt;li> tags are used to define lists. The &lt;ul> tag is used to define an unordered list, the &lt;ol> 
                                tag is used to define an ordered list, and the &lt;li> tag is used to define a list item.
                                <br> <b>Image tag:</b> The &lt;img> tag is used to insert an image into a web page.
                                <br><b>Table tag:</b> The &lt;table> tag is used to define a table.

                    <div class="div-prop">
                        <b>Tags:</b> HTML tags are used to define the different elements 
                        of a web page. They are always enclosed in angle brackets (&lt; >). The start tag defines the beginning of an element, and the end tag defines the end of an element.
                        <br><b>Attributes:</b> Attributes are additional pieces of information that can be added to HTML tags. They are always enclosed in quotes, and they are placed after the tag name. For example, the &lt;a href="https://www.google.com"> tag defines a link to the Google website. The href attribute specifies the URL of the link.
                        <br><b>Elements:</b> Elements are the basic building blocks of HTML pages. They are defined by HTML tags and attributes. Some common elements include headings, paragraphs, lists, images, and tables.
                        <br><b>Structure:</b> The structure of an HTML page is defined by the way the elements are nested. For example, a paragraph element can be nested inside a heading element.
                        <b>Formatting:</b> The formatting of an HTML page is defined by CSS. CSS is a separate language that is used to style the appearance of web pages.
                        
                    </div>
                    <h4 class="prop">CSS Properties</h4>
                    <div class="div-prop">
                        <b>Properties:</b> CSS properties are used to control the appearance of elements on a web page. They are always preceded by a colon (:). For example, the color property is used to set the color of text.
                        <br><b>Properties:</b> CSS properties are used to control the appearance of elements on a web page. They are always preceded by a colon (:). For example, the color property is used to set the color of text.
                        <br><b>Values:</b> CSS values are the values that are assigned to properties. They can be numbers, strings, or keywords. For example, the value red can be assigned to the color property to set the text color to red.
                        <br><b>Selectors:</b> CSS selectors are used to select the elements that the properties will be applied to. They can be simple, such as h1, or they can be more complex, such as div#my-div.
                        <br><b>Rules:</b> CSS rules are used to combine selectors and properties. They are always enclosed in curly braces ({}). For example, the following rule sets the font size of all h1 elements to 2em:
                        CSS
                        h1 {
                          font-size: 2em;
                        }
                        <br><b>Inheritance:</b> CSS inheritance is the process of inheriting the properties of one element to another element. For example, if the font-size property is set for the h1 element, all h2 elements will inherit that property.
                       <br> <b>Cascade:</b> CSS cascade is the process of applying properties to elements in a specific order. The first property that is applied will take precedence over the subsequent properties.
                        These are just some of the different elements of HTML and CSS. There are many other elements and properties available, and each element and property has a different purpose.

                            JavaScript has a number of built-in objects and events. 
                            Objects are used to represent things on a web page, 
                            such as the document, the window, and the form elements. 
                            Events are used to detect when something happens on a web page, 
                            such as when the user clicks on a button or moves the mouse. <br><br>
                            You can use JavaScript to access and manipulate objects, and to handle events. 
                            For example, the following code uses JavaScript to change the background 
                            color of the document when the user clicks on a button:

                                Functions are used to group code together and to make it reusable. 
                                Loops are used to repeat a block of code until a condition is met.
                            <br>    To create a function in JavaScript, you use the function keyword. 
                                To create a loop in JavaScript, you use the for, while, or do...while keywords.

                                For example, the following code uses a function and a loop to display a list of numbers from 1 to 10:
                                <br>
                                function displayNumbers() {
                                <br>    for (var i = 1; i &#8249;= 10; i++) {
                                 <br>     console.log(i);
                                 <br>   }
                                <br>  }
                                 <br>  
                                  displayNumbers();

                                <div class="valid">
                                    JavaScript can be used to validate forms to make sure that the user has entered valid data. 
                                    For example, you can use JavaScript to validate that the user has entered a valid email 
                                    address or that they have entered a password that is at least 8 characters long. <br>
                                    To validate a form in JavaScript, you use the document.getElementById() 
                                    method to get a reference to the form element. Then, you use the value property to 
                                    get the value of the form element. Finally, you use a regular expression to validate the 
                                    value of the form element.
                                    <br>
                                    For example, the following code uses JavaScript to 
                                    validate that the user has entered a valid email address:
                                </div>
                            </div>

                            <small>
                                function validateEmail() {
                                <br>    var email = document.getElementById("email").value;
                                 <br>   var re = /\S+@\S+\.\S+/;
                                <br>    if (!re.test(email)) {
                                <br>      alert("Please enter a valid email address.");
                                 <br>     return false;

                                  document.getElementById("form").addEventListener("submit", validateEmail);

                                This code will display an alert message if the user has not entered a valid email address. The code will also prevent the form from being submitted if the email address is not valid.
